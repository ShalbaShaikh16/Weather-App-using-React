# 🌦️ Weather App using React 🌦️

Welcome to the **Weather App** built using **React**! This app allows you to check the current weather in various locations, providing real-time updates, temperature, and weather conditions in an intuitive interface. Whether you're planning a trip or just curious about the weather, this app has got you covered!

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Weather Updates**: Get the current weather conditions for any city worldwide.
- **Temperature & Conditions**: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions like sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for any city to get the weather data.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works well across devices, from desktops to mobiles.

## 🎯 Goals

The main goal of this project is to practice building a **React app** that interacts with an external API to fetch real-time data. This app pulls weather information from a third-party API and dynamically updates the interface using React state and lifecycle methods.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **OpenWeather API**: The weather data is fetched from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeather API.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. If not, download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShalbaShaikh16/Weather-App-using-React.git
cd Weather-App-using-React
```

### Install Dependencies

Inside the project folder, run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the Application

To run the app in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🌐 API Integration

The weather data is fetched using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. You will need your own API key to access weather information. Here's how you can get it:

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Sign up or log in.
3. Get your API key.

Once you have your API key, replace the placeholder API key in the `src` folder (specifically in the API call configuration) with your own key.

## 📦 Project Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the folder structure in the **`src`** folder:

```
src/
│
├── components/      # Contains all the React components used in the app
│
├── App.js           # Main component that handles API calls and displays weather
├── App.css          # Global styling for the app
└── index.js         # Entry point for the React app
```
